WordPress is an excellent Content Management System (CMS). We can achieve almost anything with it. Because of its dynamic nature, we can change any content with a click of a button. And while this is amazing, it also brings some dangers, and it can get difficult to maintain under heavy traffic.

Converting your WordPress website into static might solve those problems.
What Are Static Websites?

To explain how static websites work, first, we have to understand how dynamic website works.

Every time we visit a website, the server has to parse PHP files, query the database to fetch the data, and, in the end, return the rendered HTML to the browser.

Static websites do all the heavy lifting first – before visiting the website, we save every page as static HTML. When we visit the desired page, the server serves it as it is.]]></description>
